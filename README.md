Hi, Iâ€™m @BrenainnVanhaverbeke

I'm studying DAE - Game Development in Howest Kortrijk. Stands to reason that gaming is one of my interests, either digitally or tabletop. 
Related to my education, I'm currently learning C++ and have a fair amount of experience with C#, Java, PHP and JavaScript.

My repositories will mostly be related to my education, though will likely put some experiments in here as well.
